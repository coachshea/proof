\begin{theorem}
  For any set $U$, for every $B\in \wp(U)$ there is a unique $D$ such that for
  every $C \in \wp(U), C \setminus B = C \cap D$.
\end{theorem}

\begin{proof}
  Because $B$, $D$, and $C$ are within $\wp(U)$, $\wp(U)$ is the universal set
  within the context of this problem. Suppose $D$ is the complement of $B$
  (i.e. $B^c$) within set $U$. Then $D$ is the set of all $x \notin B$ within
  $\wp(U)$. Therefore, for any possible $C \in \wp(U)$ if the members of $C$
  which also exists in $B$ are removed (i.e. $C \setminus B$), the remainder
  of the set will exist in both $C$ and $D$. Therefore, there exists a unique
  set $D$ such that for all $C$, $C \setminus B = C \cap D$. Furthermore, that
  unique set $D$ is the compliment of $B$, $B^c$.
\end{proof}
