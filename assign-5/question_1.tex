\begin{theorem}
  If $\mathscr{F}$ and $\mathscr{G}$ are families of sets, and $A$ in
  $\mathscr{F}$ and $B$ in $\mathscr{G}$, then $\cup\mathscr{F}$ and
  $\cup\mathscr{G}$ are not disjoin if $A$ and $B$ are not disjoint.
\end{theorem}

\begin{proof}
  Suppose $A$ and $B$ are not disjoint. Then there exists at least one $x$
  which exists in $A$ and $B$. Since $A$ is an element of $\mathscr{F}$ and
  $\cup\mathscr{F}$ consists of every member of the elements of $\mathscr{F}$,
  then $x$ exists in $\cup\mathscr{F}$. And since $B$ is an element of
  $\mathscr{G}$ and $\cup\mathscr{G}$ consists of every member of every
  element of $\mathscr{G}$, then $x$ exists in $\cup\mathscr{G}$. Therefore,
  $\cup\mathscr{F}$ and $\cup\mathscr{G}$ have $x$ in common and are
  subsequently not disjoint.
\end{proof}
