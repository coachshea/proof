\begin{enumerate}[label=\alph*]
  \item $S^{-1} \circ R$

    $S=\{(4,a),(4,d),(5,b),(5,c)\}$, and is a relation from $B$ to $C$, so
    $S^{-1}=\{(a,4),(d,4),(b,5),(c,5)\}$ and is a relation from $C$ to $B$.
    $R=\{(1,b),(2,a),(2,b),(2,c),(3,d)\}$ and is a relation from $A$ to
    $C$. Therefore $S^{-1} \circ R = \{(1,5),(2,4),(2,5), (3,4)\}$ and is a
    relation from $A$ to $B$. This results because we now have a relation that
    begins in $A$, connects through $C$ and arrives at $B$. The final relation
    $S^{-1} \circ R$ becomes a set of ordered pairs with elements of $A$ as
    the first coordinate and elements of $B$ as the second.

  \item $R^{-1} \circ S$

    $R=\{(1,b),(2,a),(2,b),(2,c),(3,d)\}$ and is a relation from $A$ to $C$,
    so $R^{-1}=\{(b,1),(a,2),(b,2),(c,2),(d,3)$ and is a relation from $C$ to
    $A$. $S=\{(4,a),(4,d),(5,b),(5,c)\}$ and is a relation from $B$ to $C$.
    Therefore $R^{-1} \circ S = \{(4,2),(4,3),(5,1),(5,2)\}$ is a relation
    from $B$ to $A$. This results because we now have a relation that begins
    in $B$, connects through $C$ and arrives at $A$. The final relation
    $R^{-1} \circ S$ becomes a set of ordered pairs with elements of $B$ as
    the first coordinate and elements of $A$ as the second.
