\begin{theorem}
  If $\mathscr{F}$ is a non-empty family of sets, $B$ is a set, and $\forall A
  \in \mathscr{F} (A \subseteq B)$, then $\cup \mathscr{F} \subseteq B$.
\end{theorem}

\begin{proof}
  Suppose $x \in \cup\mathscr{F}$, then $x$ must be a member of at least one
  of the sets that comprise $\mathscr{F}$. As we are given that every set in
  $\mathscr{F}$ is a subset of $B$, $x$ must exist in $B$. 
\end{proof}
