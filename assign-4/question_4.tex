\begin{theorem}
  If $x$ is a negative real number and $x < \frac{1}{x}$, then $x < -1$.
\end{theorem}

\begin{proof}
  Suppose $a$ is the absolute value of $x$. Then the given statement can be
  written as $-a < - \frac{1}{a}$. Then multiply both sides by $-a$ and we get
  $a^2 > 1$. We then take the principle square root of both sides (because $a$
  is known to be an absolute value, it is not necessary to take the plus or
  minus square root) and arrive at $a>1$. Then we multiply both sides by $-1$
  and get $-a<-1$. Finally, we insert $x$ for $-a$ and we get the desired $x <
  -1$.
