      twin.
    - More succinctly: No one is their own twin.
b. False
    - There exists at least one person who is his or her own twin.
c. False
    - There exists at least one person who is twins with every other person.
d. False
    - For all people, there is not a single person with whom they are twins.
e. True
    - There exists at least one person who does not have a twin.
f. True
    - for all people, it is not true that they are twins with everyone.
    - More succinctly: No one is twins with everyone.

## Question 2

a. $\forall \textrm{x}(5 < \textrm{x} < 10 \rightarrow \exists
      \textrm{a} \exists \textrm{b} \exists
      \textrm{c}(\textrm{a}^2+\textrm{b}^2+\textrm{c}^2=\textrm{x})).$
b. $\exists!\textrm{x}((x-4)^2=36).$
c. $\exists!\textrm{x}((x=11)^2=49).$
d. $\exists x \exists y(((x \ne y)^(x-4)^2=36)^(x-4)^2=36).$

## Question 4

a. The identity element for multiplication is 1.

b. Every positive real number has a positive multiplicative inverse.

c. No positive real number has a negative multiplicative inverse.


## Question 5

a.
    - $A_2 = \{2, 3, 4, 6\}$
        - j = 2
        - j + 1 = 3
        - j + 2 = 4
        - 2j = 4 (only one 4 is included in the set
          because two is superflous)
        - 3j = 6
    - $A_3 = \{3, 4, 5, 6, 9\}$
        - j = 3
        - j + 1 = 4
        - j + 2 = 5
        - 2j = 6
        - 3j = 9
    - $A_4 = \{4, 5, 6, 8, 12\}$
        - j = 4
        - j + 1 = 5
        - j + 2 = 6
        - 2j = 8
        - 3j = 12
b.
    - $\cap_{j \in J} A_j = \{4, 6\}$
    - $\cup_{j \in J} A_j = \{2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 8, 9, 12\}$


## Question 6

a. $\wp(A) \cup \wp(B) \subseteq \wp(A \cup B)$
b. $\wp(A) \cup \wp(B) = \wp(A \cup B)$
